Overview
--------
`Backlooper.app <https://backlooper.app>`_ is a looper that allows you to decide to loop a few bars after you played them.
It is not necessary to hit "record" before playing a loop.
Audio is always being recorded.
The last few bars will be looped if you select a track at approximately the first beat of the next bar.

For user documentation, please see `here <https://backlooper.app/docs/general>`_.

For developer documentation: you're in the right place!
